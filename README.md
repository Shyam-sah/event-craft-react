1. User Registration and Authentication
Event Craft offers a seamless user registration process, enabling individuals to create an account with ease. Users are required to provide essential details, including their name, email, and password. The application implements robust authentication mechanisms, including JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure the security and verification of user identities. Additionally, the system supports user roles, such as event organizers, attendees, to facilitate efficient access management and permissions.

Event Creation and Management
Event organizers benefit from Event Craft's intuitive interface for creating and managing events. The platform streamlines the event creation process, allowing organizers to input event details such as the event name, description, date, time, location, and ticket pricing. To enhance event categorization, the system incorporates a flexible event categorization system, enabling organizers to classify events based on types such as conferences, workshops, concerts, or sports events. Organizers have the freedom to edit event specifics, update schedules, and adjust ticket prices as needed. Moreover, the application provides the option to set event visibility, granting organizers the ability to make events public or private, thereby controlling the event's audience and registration.
